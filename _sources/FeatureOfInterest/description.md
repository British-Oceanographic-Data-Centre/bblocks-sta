## What it represents

An Observation results in a value being assigned to a phenomenon. The phenomenon is a property of a feature, the latter being the FeatureOfInterest of the Observation [OGC and ISO 19156:2011]. In the context of the Internet of Things, many Observationsâ€™ FeatureOfInterest can be the Location of the Thing. For example, the FeatureOfInterest of a wifi-connect thermostat can be the Location of the thermostat (i.e., the living room where the thermostat is located in). In the case of remote sensing, the FeatureOfInterest can be the geographical area or volume that is being sensed.
