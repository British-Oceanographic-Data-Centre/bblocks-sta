## HistoricalLocation

A HistoricalLocation represents the association of a Thing with a Location (or set of Locations) at a specific time. It allows the movement of Things, or changes in their position, to be tracked through time. Each HistoricalLocation links a Thing to one or more Locations and records the temporal information for that association.

STA HistoricalLocation is based on the concept from [OGC and ISO 19156:2001, OGC 10-004r3 and ISO 19156:2011(E), OGC Abstract Specification: Geographic information â€” Observations and Measurements.](http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=41579)
