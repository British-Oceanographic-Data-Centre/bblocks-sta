## What is represents

A Datastream groups a collection of Observations measuring the same ObservedProperty and produced by the same Sensor. [https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-088/18-088.html#datastream].

### Limitations

Observations navigation link is to an array of observation properties. This requires an extra schema element to navigate the relationship between OMS/SOSA ObservationCollection and the set of observations as direct members.
