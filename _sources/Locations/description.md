## Location

A Location represents the spatial position of a Thing. It describes where a Thing is situated, using a geometry (commonly encoded in GeoJSON) and may also include descriptive metadata and user-defined properties. A Thing may have multiple Locations, and the association between a Thing and its Locations can change over time, tracked via HistoricalLocations.

STA location is based on the concept from [OGC and ISO 19156:2001, OGC 10-004r3 and ISO 19156:2011(E), OGC Abstract Specification: Geographic information â€” Observations and Measurements.](http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=41579)
